## Introduction

In many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, it's beneficial to have a visual representation of textual data. This project aims to bridge the gap between text and image data by leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning models provided by Hugging Face.

## Features

- **Text-to-Image Conversion**: Utilize Hugging Face's powerful pipeline to generate images from textual descriptions.
- **Customization**: Easily tailor the input text and tweak model parameters to generate different types of images.
- **Scalability**: The application can handle a variety of text inputs and efficiently produce corresponding visual outputs.
- **Modularity**: The project is structured for easy integration into existing ML pipelines or applications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NitinRwt/StableDiff
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your_repo
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the application script:
